# Pure CSS Tabs

## What is this?

This is an improvement over CodePen's full css tab container.
No javascript used at all.

[Original demo](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/usHoF)

## What changed here?

- The tab container is now within the float of the page, with dynamic height.
> This means that subsequent elements will be pushed down as the content changes.
- It will not pollute elements inside the tab container
- It's written in plain CSS
- It's more clean and reusable

## Licence

Do whatever you want.

## Thanks
