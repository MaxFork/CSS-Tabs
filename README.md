#Pure CSS Tabs

[Original demo](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/usHoF)

##What changed here?

- The tab container is now within the float of the page, with dynamic height.
This means that subsequent elements will be pushed down as the content changes.
- It will not pollute elements inside the tab container
- It's written in plain CSS
- It's more clean and reusable

##Licence

Do whatever you want.
